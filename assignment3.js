//Write a brief intro on available datatypes in Javascript.

/*Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: 

primitive(or primary): String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.
composite(or reference): Object, Array, and Function(which are all types of objects) are composite data types.
special data types: Undefined and Null are special data types.

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.

The String Data Type:

The string data type is used to represent textual data(i.e.sequences of characters).Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.

Example:
var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes
var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; // single quote inside double quotes
var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';     // escaping single quote with backslash

The Number Data Type:

The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation.

Example:
var a = 25;         // integer
var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425
alert(16 / 0);  // Output: Infinity
alert(-16 / 0); // Output: -Infinity
alert(16 / -0); // Output: -Infinity
alert("Some text" / 2);       // Output: NaN
alert("Some text" / 2 + 10);  // Output: NaN
alert(Math.sqrt(-1));         // Output: NaN
The Number data type also includes some special values which are: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity âˆž, which is greater than any number.Infinity is the result of dividing a nonzero number by 0.
While NaN represents a special Not - a - Number value.It is a result of an invalid or an undefined mathematical operation, like taking the square root of - 1 or dividing 0 by 0, etc.

The Boolean Data Type:

The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.It is typically used to store values like yes(true) or no(false), on(true) or off(false).

Example:

var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
alert(b > a) // Output: true
alert(b > c) // Output: false

The Undefined Data Type:

The undefined data type can only have one value - the special value undefined.If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.

Example:

var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(a) // Output: undefined
alert(b) // Output: Hello World!

The Null Data Type:

This is another special data type that can have only one value - the null value.A null value means that there is no value.It is not equivalent to an empty string("") or 0, it is simply nothing.A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.

Example:

var a = null;
alert(a); // Output: null
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(b); // Output: Hello World!
b = null;
alert(b) // Output: null

The Object Data Type:

The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

An object contains properties, defined as a key - value pair.A property key(name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.

Example:

var emptyObject = {};
var person = { "name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36" };
var car = {
 "modal": "BMW X3",
 "color": "white",
 "doors": 5
}
var car = {
 modal: "BMW X3",
 color: "white",
 doors: 5
}

The Array Data Type:

An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable.Each value(also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type - numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays.The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].

Example:

var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
alert(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
alert(cities[2]);   // Output: New York

The Function Data Type:

The function is callable object that executes a block of code.Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables.

Example:

var greeting = function () {
 return "Hello World!";
}
// Check the type of greeting variable
alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!

function createGreeting(name) {
 return "Hello, " + name;
}
function displayGreeting(greetingFunction, userName) {
 return greetingFunction(userName);
}

var result = displayGreeting(createGreeting, "Peter");
alert(result); // Output: Hello, Peter
